# LEGO SPIKE PRIME Extension for VS Code (v0.0.2)

This extension for VS Code will allow you to easily program the SPIKE PRIME in a micropython environment. Credit to @nutki for the prior work on actually transferring files to the hub.

This tool was created by Sanjay Seshan for http://PrimeLessons.org. If there are any errors or you need additional help, please do not hesistate to open and issue on this Github repository.

## Features

The avaliable commands are: "Upload to SPIKE PRIME", "List SPIKE PRIME files", "Delete SPIKE PRIME file", "Start SPIKE PRIME program", "Stop SPIKE PRIME program", "Move SPIKE PRIME program", "SPIKE PRIME Firmware Info", and "Create new SPIKE PRIME micropython program" (from template). The end result is that you can run micropython programs on your hub just like a standard scratch program
